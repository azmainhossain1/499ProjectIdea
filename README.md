Title : Resturant Recommendations (Like Yelp)

Create a website where you can find restaurant recommendations based off the certain filters you choose and your preferences.

You can choose around what location you are searching for, type of food you want (meat, vegetarian etc.), how much you are willing to spend 
and you can see the ratings of the restaurant. 

To design the website you would use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and You would also utilize an API
